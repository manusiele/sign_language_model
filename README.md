Sign Language Translation App

Overview

This project provides an Android-based application for real-time sign language translation using a TensorFlow Lite model. The model is downloaded from a public GitHub repository, cached locally to optimize performance, and used for inference on images or video frames captured from the device camera. The app translates sign language gestures into text or spoken words.


---

Features

Model Downloading & Caching: The model is downloaded from a GitHub repository and cached locally for future use, reducing repeated downloads.

Real-time Inference: Uses TensorFlow Lite for fast, efficient inference directly on the device.

Offline Functionality: Once the model is cached, the app works fully offline.

Fast Performance: Optimized for minimal latency, ensuring real-time translation with low resource consumption.



---

Requirements

Android 8.0 (API level 26) or higher

TensorFlow Lite support

OkHttp (or any HTTP client) for downloading the model

Kotlin or Java as the primary language for the app



---

Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-language-translation-app.git

2. Open the Project in Android Studio

Open the project in Android Studio and let it sync with the necessary dependencies.

3. Add Dependencies

In your build.gradle (Module: app), ensure you have the necessary dependencies for OkHttp and TensorFlow Lite.

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.9.1'  // OkHttp for model download
    implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:2.8.0'  // TensorFlow Lite for inference
}

4. Configure Model Download URL

The app will download the model from the following GitHub URL:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manusiele/sign_language_model/main/your_model.tflite

Ensure this URL points to the correct model file in the GitHub repository.

5. Set Up Permissions

Make sure your Android app has the necessary permissions in AndroidManifest.xml for internet access and camera use.

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>

How it Works

Model Download & Caching

The app first checks if the model is already cached locally. If the model is not found, it downloads the model file from the GitHub repository and stores it in the app's internal storage for future use. This reduces unnecessary data usage and ensures the app runs smoothly without re-downloading the model every time.

TensorFlow Lite Inference

After caching the model, the app uses TensorFlow Lite to perform inference on real-time input from the device's camera. The input can be an image or video frame, which is processed by the model to predict the sign language gesture.


---

Code Overview

1. Model Download (via OkHttp)

The model is fetched from the specified GitHub raw URL, and is cached in the app's internal storage.

2. Loading and Running the Model

Once the model is available locally, the app uses TensorFlow Lite's Interpreter to load the model and run inference. The input (gesture or image) is preprocessed, passed to the model, and the result is post-processed into a meaningful output (text or audio translation).

3. Inference Result

The output of the model inference is translated into text or speech, providing the user with the translated gesture.


---

Caching Strategy

The model is cached in the app's internal storage to reduce repeated downloads and ensure faster access.

The model is only downloaded once unless a new version is detected.

In future releases, you may implement cache expiry logic if a model update is required.



---

Example Usage

Once the app is installed and running, it will automatically:

1. Check if the model is available locally.


2. If not, download the model from the specified GitHub URL.


3. Cache the model locally for future use.


4. Allow users to capture video frames or images and perform real-time sign language translation.
